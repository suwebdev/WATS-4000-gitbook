# Notes for Windows Users

This book assumes a Unix-like development environment. This is sometimes a bit tricky to set up if you're new to web development and you use Windows. Macs and Linux run a bash interface, and after you install git on Windows you'll have access to [git bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) which is a windows application that provides a bash interface similar to what you experience on a Mac or Linux OS.

## Notes for Pre-Windows 10 Users

If you are using a version of Windows before Windows 10, and you cannot upgrade, then you might need to look into some other tools for making your command line environment more comfortable.

You might consider installing the [CMDER](http://cmder.net/) tool, which adds a lot of functionality to the default Windows command line terminal. This includes basic Unix commands that are missing by default from Windows as well as nicer coloring and prompts so you can have a more effective interface.

If you are using [CMDER](http://cmder.net/) for your terminal, then you may need to do a little extra setup to make Git work on the command line with your SSH Keys. [This article](https://web.archive.org/web/20160206132434/http://awmoore.com/2015/01/14/setting-up-git-and-cmder/) covers that setup quite well, so you should probably read it. \(Please note: This is a link to an archived version of the article, which is still relevant, but no longer hosted on the original site.\)
