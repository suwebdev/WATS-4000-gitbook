# Notes for Windows Users

This book assumes a Unix-like development environment. This is sometimes a bit tricky to set up if you're new to web development and you use Windows. Macs and Linux run a bash interface, and after you install git on Windows you'll have access to [git bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) which is a windows application that provides a bash interface similar to what you experience on a Mac or Linux OS.

Please consider purchasing a new computer if you area Windows user and can't upgrade to Windows 10.
