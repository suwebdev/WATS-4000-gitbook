# Notes for Windows Users

This book assumes a Unix-like development environment. This is sometimes a bit tricky to set up if you're new to web development and you use Windows. \(Macs run Unix, and Linux machines work very much like Unix, so those systems are a little more of a "natural" fit for this kind of work.\)

When you install **git** on your Windows Machine, you will get a program called **Git Bash**.  **Git Bash** will provide a bash interface, the same interface used on the MacOS and many Linux system.  You will be able to execute all the commands you need for this course using Git Bash.  To run **Git Bash**, just install git, and choose the option to add it to your path.  Then use the windows button to search for **git bash** and execute it.  You'll see a terminal that will execute most Bash commands

## Notes for Pre-Windows 10 Users

If you are using a version of Windows before Windows 10, consider purchasing a new computer that will support Windows 10 as there may be memory and security issues with earlier versions of Windows.
