# Setting Up the Workspace

In this section we will look at some of the tools for setting up modern web development workspaces. We will look at what we mean by the phrase "development environment", and why developers spend so much effort on setting up a good one. We will also install the tools we will need to work through all the concepts that the rest of this book explores.

It's important to realize that every system is unique, and there may well be challenges that you run into that are not covered in this book. To overcome those challenges will take ingenuity, research, and effort. Hopefully the links in this book combined with some good Google skills will help you get out of any tough situations.
